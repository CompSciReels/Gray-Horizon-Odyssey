#Script 1 - AAA: Deactivate GameObject on Button Click

This Unity script deactivates a specified GameObject when the attached button is clicked. Make sure to assign the target GameObject in the objectToDeactivate field. If the button or GameObject isn't set, a warning will appear in the console.

#Script 2 - AASPOT: Enable Child Button on Parent Button Click

This Unity script disables a child button on start and re-enables it when the parent button is clicked. It automatically finds the parent button and subscribes to its onClick event. If the parent button isn't found, a warning is logged.

#Script 3 - ActivateButtonClick: Toggle Menu Visibility

This Unity script hides a menu on start and toggles its visibility when a button is clicked. The script references the entire menu object and switches its active state on each button click.
